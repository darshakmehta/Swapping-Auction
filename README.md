# Stage 1
  Creating a set of static HTML5 pages which serves as look-and-feel design prototype for later functional/dynamic application development
  
  Common look-and-feel elements are rendered exactly the same, to show the seamless transitions with no jitter between pages for common elements.
  
  
# Stage 2
  Serving views and defining routes
  
  Implement MVC Design Pattern to structure the web application.
  
    Model - JavaScript Data Objects to implement the business layer of the application
    View -  EJS Pages to present the view to the browser
    Control - Using Routes to control the flow of the application
  
  We will define EJS Pages for the presentation, routes for the controller and JavaScript data objects for the business logic
  
 
# Stage 3
  Implement sessions to maintain state in our application

  Complete MVC Architecture
